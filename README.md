This is a repository associated to the Università di Bologna Master on Theoretical Physics masters' thesis of Carlos García Sánchez entitled _"Early matter domination from a dark photon at colliders"_. 
In this repository the user will find all the Jupyter Notebook files and the data files necessary to reproduce the results of the thesis. The two main files are _''Numerical integration of Friedmann eq dilution factor.ipynb''_ and _''Dilution Factor and Dark Photon.ipynb''_. 
In the first one the numerical factor of the dilution factor is computed. In the second one all plots included in the thesis can be generated. 

**IMPORTANT:** to get to run the code the data files need to be in the dame folder of the .ipynb files.
