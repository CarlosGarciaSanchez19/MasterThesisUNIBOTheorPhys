This is a repository associated to the Università di Bologna Master on Theoretical Physics masters' thesis of Carlos García Sánchez entitled "Early matter domination from a dark photon at colliders". 
In this repository the user will find all the Jupyter Notebook files and the data files necessary to reproduce the results of the thesis. The two main files are ''Numerical integration of Friedmann eq dilution factor.ipynb'' 
and ''Dilution Factor and Dark Photon.ipynb''. In the first one the numerical factor of the dilution factor is computed. In the second one all plots included in the thesis can be generated.
